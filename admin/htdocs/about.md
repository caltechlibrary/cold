# About COLD

COLD is a web application developed by Caltech Library Digital Library Development Group.
It is used to managed object lists and dictionaries. COLD stands for Controlled Object
Lists and Data. That latter usually means vocabulary lists that get rendered out as YAML files.

This is a prototype UI.
