Installation for development of **cold**
===========================================

**cold** Caltech Library maintains a list of people, groups and funders and their related identifiers. For many years these were managed using a spreadsheets. That has become cumbersome. **COLD** manages data as JSON objects in [dataset](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset) collections.

**COLD** is implemented as three web web services

- cold web UI
- cold JSON API (provided by datasetd)
- cold reports (the report request system)

Reports are implemented as a set of programs or bash scripts.

TypeScript+Deno is used to implement the web UI and report system.
The JSON API is provided by Dataset&#x27;s datasetd.
Access control is provided by the front end web server integrated with Shibboleth.

Quick install with curl or irm
------------------------------

There is an experimental installer.sh script that can be run with the following command to install latest table release. This may work for macOS, Linux and if youâ€™re using Windows with the Unix subsystem. This would be run from your shell (e.g. Terminal on macOS).

~~~shell
curl https://caltechlibrary.github.io/cold/installer.sh | sh
~~~

This will install the programs included in cold in your `$HOME/bin` directory.
