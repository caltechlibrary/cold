Caltech Library maintains a list of people, groups and funders and their related identifiers. For many years these were managed using a spreadsheets. That has become cumbersome. **COLD** manages data as JSON objects in [dataset](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset) collections. TypeScript provides a middleware for the user interface with datasetd providing object management. The front end web server provides access control (e.g. via Shibboleth).

**COLD** is implemented as a set of localhost web services and collection of programs and scripts. The localhost web services for managing controlled object lists and datum.
