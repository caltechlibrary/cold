Controlled Object Lists & Vocabularies
======================================

This is the management interface for [cold](readme.html). It is organized around managed objects and static vocabularies.

Managable Objects
-----------------

- [People](./people/)
- [Groups](./groups/)
- [Funders](./funders/)

Static Vocabularies
-------------------

Vocabularies are static. They are read only key/value pair lists provided by the **cold** application.  **cold** source code must be updated and compiled to change the key/value pairs in the lists.
