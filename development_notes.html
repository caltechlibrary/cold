<h1 id="development-notes">Development Notes</h1>
<h2 id="application-layout-and-structure">Application layout and
structure</h2>
<p>The primary task of the COLD UI is to provide a means of curating our
list of objects and vocabularies. Each list is held in a dataset
collection. Datasetd is used to provide a JSON API to curate the
individual objects for each of our collections. TypeScript running via
Deno is providing the middleware to tie our JSON API with our static
content. The front end web server (i.e. Apache 2) provides integration
with Shibboleth provides single sign on and access control.</p>
<p>I am relying on feeds.library.caltech.edu to provide the public
facing API. Data is transfered to feeds via scripts run on a schedule or
“on demand” via a Deno task running.</p>
<h2 id="the-go-dataset-and-models-package">The Go dataset and models
package</h2>
<p>The latest evolution of dataset includes support for restricting
collections to specific data models. A model is base on data types that
easily map from HTML 5 form elements to SQL data types. Additionally
there are types associated with library and archives such as support for
ISNI, ORCID and ROR. Dataset still supports adhoc JSON object storage if
that is needed.</p>
<p>The data models ar enforced only via the datasetd service. Eventually
model support will be unforced for the dataset cli.</p>
<p>Data models are expressed in YAML and are shared between dataset and
the model YAML used by Newt. Both use the same models package written in
Go. The models package procides a means of define more types as well as
adding renders. It is being developed in parallel with Newt, Dataset and
the COLD where the latter is providing a real world use case to test the
approach.</p>
<p>The public API isn’t part of COLD directly. COLD is for curating
object lists but it does export those objects to
feeds.library.caltech.edu which then provides the public API. Content is
exported in JSON, YAML and CSV formats as needed by Caltech Library
systems and services.</p>
<h2 id="reports">Reports</h2>
<p>Reports are implemented either as dataset SQL queries or other
scripts. Since reports can be slow to run and consume reports are
implemented using a task queue. Reports are requests, the results
rendered and then a link is created and available on the completed
reports page. A link is also emailed to the requestor.</p>
<p>Reports are implemented as a tasks. A task is defined in Deno’s JSON
file. A Deno task isn’t limited to TypeScript or JavaScript. It can all
out to run other programs which in turn can be written in Bash, Python
or be a simple dsquery. Limitting external execution of defined tasks is
important for the security of the system and host machine. This is why
the tasks are predefined. Adhoc reports are not implemented in COLD.</p>
<h2 id="data-enhancement">Data enhancement</h2>
<p>The content curated in cold is enhanced from external source. This is
done via scheduled tasks. An example is biographical and other
information published in the Caltech Directory is harvested and merged
into our Caltech People objects.</p>
<p>External data sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Caltech Directory</li>
<li>orcid.org</li>
<li>ror.org</li>
