<h1 id="development-notes">Development Notes</h1>
<h2 id="application-layout-and-structure">Application layout and
structure</h2>
<p>The primary task of the COLD UI is to provide a means of curating our
list of objects and vocabularies. Each list is held in a dataset
collection. Datasetd is used to provide a JSON API to curate the
collections. TypeScript compiled via Deno is providing the middleware to
tie our JSON API with our static content. The front end web server
(i.e. Apache 2) provides integration with Shibboleth provides single
sign on and access control.</p>
<p>I am relying on feeds.library.caltech.edu to provide the public
facing API. Data is transfered to feeds via scripts run on a schedule or
“on demand” via JavaScript contacting external systems. Deno can compile
the TypeScript code to JavaScript for browser consumption using the
“<span class="citation" data-cites="deno/emit">@deno/emit</span>”
module.</p>
<h2 id="the-go-dataset-and-models-package">The Go dataset and models
package</h2>
<p>The latest evolution of dataset includes support for restricting
collections to specific data models. A model is base on data types that
easily map from HTML 5 form elements to SQL data types. Additionally
there are types associated with library and archives such as support for
ISNI, ORCID and ROR. Dataset still supports adhoc JSON object storage if
that is needed.</p>
<p>The data models ar enforced only via the datasetd service. Eventually
model support will be unforced for the dataset cli.</p>
<p>Data models are expressed in YAML and are shared between dataset and
the model YAML used by Newt. Both use the same models package written in
Go. The models package procides a means of define more types as well as
adding renders. It is being developed in parallel with Newt, Dataset and
the COLD where the latter is providing a real world use case to test the
approach.</p>
<p>The public API isn’t part of COLD directly. COLD is for curating
object lists but it does export those objects to
feeds.library.caltech.edu which then provides the public API. Content is
exported in JSON, YAML and CSV formats as needed by Caltech Library
systems and services.</p>
<h2 id="reports">Reports</h2>
<p>Reports are implemented either as dataset SQL queries or other
scripts. Reports can be slow to run. A request queue is implemented to
solve that problem. Reports requests are qued via the COLD UI. A
separate process reads the queue, renders the reports and then updates
the queue upon completion or error. When reports are available an
optional email can be sent to the requestor based on the information
included in the original request.</p>
<p>The individual reports correspond to a program which can be written
in your language of choice (e.g. Python, Bash, TypeScript). The report
runner</p>
<p>Reports are implemented as a tasks. A task is defined in Deno’s JSON
file. A Deno task isn’t limited to TypeScript or JavaScript. It can all
out to run other programs which in turn can be written in Bash, Python
or be a simple dsquery. Limitting external execution of defined tasks is
important for the security of the system and host machine. This is why
the tasks are predefined. Adhoc reports are not implemented in COLD.</p>
<h2 id="data-enhancement">Data enhancement</h2>
<p>The content curated in cold can be enhanced from external sources.
This is done via scheduled tasks. Initially these tasks are going to be
run from cron. An example is biographical and other information
published in the Caltech Directory. For a subset of CaltechPEOPLE we
know their IMSS userid. Using that we can contact the public directory
website and return the biographical details such as their faculty role
and title, division, and educational backgroup. We only harvest those
records that have both a directory user id and are marked for inclusion
in feeds.</p>
<p>External data sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Caltech Directory</li>
<li>orcid.org</li>
<li>ror.org</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reports-1">Reports</h2>
<p>Reports are often needed for managing library data and systems.
COLD’s focus is on managing lists and data but can also serve as a
reports request hub.</p>
<p>Many of the reports require aggrestion across data sources and often
these will take too long or require too many resources to be run
directly on our applicaiton server. That suggests what should run on the
applications server is a simple reports request management interface.
The suggestions the following requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li>A way to make a request for a report</li>
<li>A means of indicating a report status (e.g. requested or scheduled,
processing, available or problem indicator)</li>
<li>A means of notifying the requestor(s) when report is available</li>
<li>A means of purging old reports for the reports status list</li>
</ul>
<p>These features can be implemented as a simple queue. The metadata
needed to manage a report requests and their life cycle are as
follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>name of report</li>
<li>any additional options needed by the report program</li>
<li>an email address(es) to contact when the report is ready</li>
<li>current status of the report (e.g. requested, processing, available,
problem)</li>
<li>a link to where the report can be “picked up”</li>
<li>the report’s content type, (e.g. application/json, application/yaml,
application/x-sqlite3, text/csv, text/plain, text/x-markdown)</li>
<li>the date the report was requested</li>
<li>the updated (when the status last changed)</li>
</ul>
<p>The user interface would consist of a simple web form to request a
predefined set up reports and a list of reports available, processing,
requested or scheduled.</p>
<p>The reports themselves can be implemented as commmand line programs
in a language of your choice. The report runner will be responsible for
checking the queue and updating the queue. The report would be
responsible for notification (e.g. is there is an email list then send
out an email with the report link). In princle since our GitHub actions
are accessible via the GitHub APIs a report could be implemented as a
GitHub action.</p>
<p>The advantage of this approach is that it avoids the problems of slow
running or resource intensive reports running directly on the
application server. COLD just manages the report queue.</p>
<p>Advantage of narrowing the COLD’s report to managing a report queue
is that it separates the concerns (e.g. resource management, security,
report access).</p>
<p>For the report management interface to be useful you do need a report
runner. The report runner would be responsible for checking the report
queue, updating status of the report queue and making the report
request.</p>
<p>NOTE: the runner doesn’t need to run on your apps server. It just
needs access to the queue.</p>
<p>A report would need to implement a few things.</p>
<ul>
<li>accept the metadata held in the report queue</li>
<li>storing the report result</li>
<li>return a result needed by the runner to update the report queue
(success, failure and the link to the result)</li>
</ul>
<p>QUESTION: Should the report be responsible for notification or the
runner?</p>
<p>The individual reports can be implemented as a script (e.g. Bash), a
program (e.g. something in Python) or even externally (e.g. GitHub
action). The interface for the report would be to recieve a JSON
expression from standard input and return a JSON expression via standard
output to the runner along with an error code (i.e. zero no problem,
non-zero there was a problem). The report script or program would use a
link to indicate where the report could be picked up and be responsible
to placing content in a storage location accessbile via the link.</p>
<p>Report status:</p>
<dl>
<dt>requested</dt>
<dd>
An entry that a request has been made and is waiting to be serviced
</dd>
<dt>processing</dt>
<dd>
The report reqest is being serviced but is not yet available
</dd>
<dt>available</dt>
<dd>
A report result is available and the link indicates where you can pick
it up
</dd>
<dt>problem</dt>
<dd>
The report request could not be completed and the link indicates where
the details can be found about what when wrong.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Report identifiers:</p>
<p>There are two basic report types. Those which are run on a schedule
(e.g. recent grant report from thesis or creators report from authors)
and those which are requested then run. For the scheduled reports the
identifier would be in the reports’ unqiue name. For requested reports
another mechanism maybe required. A good canidate for the identifier
would be UUID v5. Since the report script or program is responsible for
storing the results it would also be responsble for versioning the
stored results if needed. By separating the ID from the report instance
it is left to the report what the name of the stored result is while
still being able to map a request to that link’s instance.</p>
<p>Reports can be of different content types. Most reports we generate
manually today are either CSV, tab demlimited or Excel files. By
allowing reports to have different content types we also allow for the
report to be provided in a relavant type. E.g. a report could be
generated as a PDF or even an SQLite3 database.</p>
<h3 id="explorting-the-report-runner">Explorting the report runner</h3>
<p>COLD provides a collection called “reports.ds”. Assuming that
collection is readable on your data processing machine a runner needs to
be able to do several actions.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Retrieve the next report to initiate</li>
<li>Update the report status (e.g. request -&gt; processing)</li>
<li>The runner needs to execute the shell command that implements the
report</li>
<li>Update the report status (e.g. processing -&gt; available or
processing -&gt; problem)</li>
</ol>
<p>The report runner repeats these four steps until there are no more
requests available. At that time it can sleep for a designated period of
time then start the loop again when requests are available.</p>
<p>To control what is executed it is desirable to have a specific
configurable task runner available. This will prevent arbetrary commends
from running.</p>
<p>Off the shelf task runners include</p>
<ul>
<li>Make, a build system dating back to the origin times of Unix</li>
<li>just, a new simpler command runner that is cross platform and
language agnostic</li>
</ul>
<p>The report runner would take the report request record, set statu to
processing and then pass the report name and options to task runner.
When the task completed (either successfully or failing) the result
would be captured and stored in a designated storage system
(e.g. G-Drive) and the report request record would need to be updated
with the final status and link to the report or error report.</p>
<h2 id="date-handling">Date Handling</h2>
<p>The difference between date formats, languages and representation can
be considerable. The default way a the TypeScript/JavaScript Date object
render a date is “MM/DD/YYYY” using the <code>toDateString()</code>
instance method. Our databases and most of our code base expects date to
be formated in “YYYY-MM-DD” so I am using two TypeScript/JavaScript
methods to achieve that. First you use <code>.toJSON()</code> to render
the date in JSON format then you trim the result to 11 characters usign
<code>.substring(0,10)</code>.</p>
<h2 id="booleans-and-webforms">Booleans and webforms</h2>
<p>When the web form is transcribed checkboxes return a “on” if checked
value. We want these to be actual JSON booleans so in the middleware is
a functions that checks for “true” or “on” before setting the value to
the boolean <code>true</code>. This will help normalize for changed and
saved records.</p>
